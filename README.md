## Learning Note

This was one of my earliest C++ projects. At the time, I had just started learning about functions, user input, and random number generation. I later learned about:

- Pass-by-reference
- Classes and objects
- Code refactoring

I plan to rebuild this project using classes, separate .cpp and .hpp files and better modularization in the future to reflect my growth as a developer.
